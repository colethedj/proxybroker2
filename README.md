ProxyBroker is an open source tool that asynchronously finds public proxies from multiple sources and concurrently checks them.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/constverum/ProxyBroker/master/docs/source/_static/index_find_example.gif)

Features
--------

-   Finds more than 7000 working proxies from \~50 sources.
-   Support protocols: HTTP(S), SOCKS4/5. Also CONNECT method to ports 80 and 23 (SMTP).
-   Proxies may be filtered by type, anonymity level, response time, country and status in DNSBL.
-   Work as a proxy server that distributes incoming requests to external proxies. With automatic proxy rotation.
-   All proxies are checked to support Cookies and Referer (and POST requests if required).
-   Automatically removes duplicate proxies.
-   Is asynchronous.

Usage
-----

### CLI Examples

#### Find

Find and show 10 HTTP(S) proxies from United States with the high level of anonymity:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ proxybroker find --types HTTP HTTPS --lvl High --countries US --strict -l 10
```

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/constverum/ProxyBroker/master/docs/source/_static/cli_find_example.gif)

#### Grab

Find and save to a file 10 US proxies (without a check):

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ proxybroker grab --countries US --limit 10 --outfile ./proxies.txt
```

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/constverum/ProxyBroker/master/docs/source/_static/cli_grab_example.gif)

#### Serve

Run a local proxy server that distributes incoming requests to a pool of found HTTP(S) proxies with the high level of anonymity:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ proxybroker serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8888 --types HTTP HTTPS --lvl High --min-queue 5
```

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/constverum/ProxyBroker/master/docs/source/_static/cli_serve_example.gif)

Run `proxybroker --help` for more information on the options available.
Run `proxybroker <command> --help` for more information on a command.

### Basic code example

Find and show 10 working HTTP(S) proxies:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
import asyncio
from proxybroker import Broker

async def show(proxies):
    while True:
        proxy = await proxies.get()
        if proxy is None: break
        print('Found proxy: %s' % proxy)

proxies = asyncio.Queue()
broker = Broker(proxies)
tasks = asyncio.gather(
    broker.find(types=['HTTP', 'HTTPS'], limit=10),
    show(proxies))

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(tasks)
```

[More examples](https://proxybroker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).

### Proxy information per requests
#### HTTP
Check `X-Proxy-Info` header in response.
```
$ http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888 https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888 curl -v http://httpbin.org/get
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8888 (#0)

```

#### HTTPS
We are not able to modify HTTPS traffic to inject custom header once they start being encrypted. A `X-Proxy-Info` will be sent to client after `HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established` but not sure how clients can read it.
```

### HTTP API
#### Get info of proxy been used for retrieving specific url
For HTTP, it's easy.
```
$ http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888 https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888 curl -v http://proxycontrol/api/history/url:http://httpbin.org/get
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8888 (#0)
> GET http://proxycontrol/api/history/url:http://httpbin.org/get HTTP/1.1
> Host: proxycontrol
> User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
> Accept: */*
> Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: application/json
< Content-Length: 34
< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
< Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
<
{"proxy": "..."}
```

For HTTPS, we're not able to know encrypted payload (request), so only hostname can be used.
```
$ http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888 https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888 curl -v http://proxycontrol/api/history/url:httpbin.org:443
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8888 (#0)
> GET http://proxycontrol/api/history/url:httpbin.org:443 HTTP/1.1
> Host: proxycontrol
> User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
> Accept: */*
> Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: application/json
< Content-Length: 34
< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
< Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
<
{"proxy": "..."}
* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact
```

#### Remove specific proxy from queue
```
$ http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888 https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888 curl -v http://proxycontrol/api/remove/PROXY_IP:PROXY_PORT
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8888 (#0)
> GET http://proxycontrol/api/remove/... HTTP/1.1
> Host: proxycontrol
> User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
> Accept: */*
> Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive
>
< HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
<
* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact
```
